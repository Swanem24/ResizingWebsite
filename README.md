# ResizingWebsite

This is a repository created for learning how to make a responsive website. 

My goal is to create a website that resizes the website depending on the user. If the user drags the browser to make it smaller it should make everything in the website scale down accordingly.

What I learned:
- Em (em is a measuring unit for fonts)
- Rem (rem is root em. it checks for the root element in the tag instead of his parents tag.)
